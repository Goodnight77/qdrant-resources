## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following forms:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step implementations teaching specific Qdrant concepts (can include guides)
- **Projects**: Complete working examples with all necessary scripts and dependencies
- **Bug fixes**: Corrections to existing tutorials or code
- **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing content

## Creating New Tutorials

Tutorials teach specific Qdrant concepts or features. They can be:
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) - preferred for interactive, step-by-step learning
- Python scripts (`.py`) - for standalone demonstrations
- Any format that effectively teaches the concept

### Guidelines for Tutorials

1. **Location**: Place tutorials in the appropriate existing folder or create a new one if needed:
   - `Qdrant-101/` - Basic Qdrant concepts and getting started
   - `RAG/` - Retrieval Augmented Generation examples
   - `quantization/` - Vector quantization techniques
   - `Agents/` - Agent-based implementations
   - `image-recommendation/` - Image recommendation systems

2. **Format**: Choose the format that best suits your tutorial (Jupyter notebooks are preferred for their interactive nature)

3. **Structure**:
   - Start with a clear title and description
   - Include prerequisites and dependencies
   - Add installation instructions if needed
   - Provide step-by-step explanations
   - Include code comments
   - End with a summary or next steps

4. **Requirements**: If your tutorial needs specific dependencies, include a `requirements.txt` file in the folder

5. **Guides** (optional but recommended): Create accompanying markdown guides (`.md` files) in the tutorial folder to:
   - Explain complex concepts covered in the tutorial
   - Provide setup instructions (e.g., how to obtain and set API keys)
   - Document configuration steps
   - Add troubleshooting tips
   - Include additional context or theory
   - Common naming: `README.md`, `setup_guide.md`, `colab_checklist.md`, etc.

### Example Tutorial Structure

```markdown
# Tutorial Title

## Overview
Brief description of what this tutorial covers

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Basic knowledge of vector databases

## Installation
```python
!pip install qdrant-client
```

## Step 1: Setup
...
```

### Example Tutorial Folder with Guides

```markdown
image-recommendation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image_rec_qdrant.ipynb    # Main tutorial notebook
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launch.py          # Launch script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt            # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Overview and usage guide
```

## Creating New Projects

Projects are complete, self-contained implementations with all necessary scripts and resources.

### Guidelines for Projects

1. **Location**: Create a new folder in the root directory for each project

2. **Required Files**:
   - `README.md` - Project overview, setup instructions, and usage
   - `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies
   - Main scripts and modules
   - Sample data or instructions to obtain data (if applicable)

3. **Folder Structure Example**:
   ```markdown
   my_project/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_data.json
   ```

4. **README Requirements**:
   - Project description
   - Features
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration options
   - License information

## Existing Folder Structure

Our current repository structure:

- `Agents/` - LangGraph and agent-based implementations
- `Qdrant-101/` - Foundational Qdrant tutorials
- `quantization/` - Vector quantization tutorials
- `RAG/` - Retrieval Augmented Generation examples (LangChain, LlamaIndex)

If your contribution doesn't fit into an existing folder, feel free to create a new one with a descriptive name.
